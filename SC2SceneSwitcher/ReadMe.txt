Usage
################
Download the current Ankhbot version: https://www.ankhbot.com/download/

Download and install Python 2.7.13 since that's needed for AnkhBot and Scripting features: 
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.msi 

Open AnkhBot and go to the "Scripts" tab in the bottom sidebar.
Click on the cogwheel in the top right and set your Python directory to the `Lib` folder where you installed Python 
(By default it should be `C:\Python27\Lib`).

Copy the script to `AnkhBotFolder\Twitch\Scripts\`

Go back to the `Scripts` tab in AnkhBot and rightclick the background and click "Reload Scripts".
The script should now appear in AnkhBot and you can configure your betting system script.

Don't forget to enable the checkbox "Enable OBS Scene Switcher" and then the scene switcher should work for you!
