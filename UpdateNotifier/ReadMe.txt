Description
###############
Every time the script loads and is enabled it will check if all your scripts are up to date or not.

The script has four methods on how it can tell you if there are different versions:
- Notification per Log on the scripts tab in Chatbot
- Notification per Logfile.txt in the "UpdateNotifier" folder
- Notification on Twitch Chat
- Notification in a whisper message on Twitch
You can also let the script tell you if every script is up to date with the last checkbox.

!IMPORTANT NOTE!:
This script compares it to a manually updated list so if you're a developer and released a new version - make sure to tell me (Brain) per discord DM the name, version and website of the script.
