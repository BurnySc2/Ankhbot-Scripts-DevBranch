Usage
################
This script creates two text files called "Uptime.txt" and "Countdown.txt" in the following path: "..\AnkhBotR2\Twitch\Files".
For usage add them as textsource in your streaming software (OBS) or just by simply drag'n'drop into it.

# Uptime.txt: 
Displays the uptime of your running stream in the format you want.
It will automatically start counting up when your stream is indicated as live on Twitch and will reset itself after your stream was offline longer then the "Max Sleep Timer".
If your stream got interrupted by a crash on OBS or Twitch is having problems it stops counting up.
If you reconnect/restart your stream within the "Max Sleep Timer" the uptime will continue again. 

# Countdown.txt:
Displays a simple countdown in a format you want and after the countdown reaches 0 it will show the text from the "Custom Text after Countdown" textbox.


You can also set the countdown and uptime manually by using the commands in the respective area in the Scripts sidebar.
"Set countdown chat command" & "Set uptime chat command".

Use that specific command + the amount of time in minutes you want to set it to.
Example: !countdown 5 (Sets the countdown to 5 minutes)
Example: !setuptime 150 (Sets the uptime to 2 hours and 30 minutes)
